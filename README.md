# **JavaScript array methods**
### Written by: ***Kevin Nzioki***

## Description
The purpose for this is to illustrate the different types of JavaScript array methods.
There are a number of array methods, but in this tutorial, I am covering only forEach, filter, map, sort and reduce.
forEach() - Calls a function for each array element.
filter() - Creates a new array with every element in an array that pass a test.
map() - Creates a new array with the result of calling a function for each array element.
sort() - Sorts the elements of an array.
reduce() - Reduce the values of an array to a single value (going left-to-right)

## Setup
Fork and clone the repository.
Run the code on the text editor of your choice.
Open an empty webpage and go to the console section.
You can then comment out the console.logs in the code for you to see the results in the wepage console.
